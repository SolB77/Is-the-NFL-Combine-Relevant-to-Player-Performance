# Is-the-NFL-Combine-Relevant-to-Player-Performance
Completed an analysis on the relationship between the combine performance and future league performance of 941 NFL players drafted between 2015 and 2017 using R. Proved that the combine performance of NFL players has little to no correlation on future player performance using linear regression. My goal was to show that the NFL Combine should not be an important factor in how players are drafted. This repository contains "Preliminary Data Cleanup", an RMD of my data pre-processing, and "Is the NFL Combine Relevant to Player Performance", a PDF of my RMD analysis and results.
